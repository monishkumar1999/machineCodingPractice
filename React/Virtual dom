here we know about the virtual DOM first we have to understand the DOM first

                            DOM
when the browser open the web page first read the html then create the object memeory in ram connected like tree this structure is DOM

html code:
<body>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</body>

dom tree :
Document
 â””â”€â”€ html
      â””â”€â”€ body
           â”œâ”€â”€ h1
           â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Text: "Hello"
           â””â”€â”€ p
                â””â”€â”€ Text: "World"

element node is h1
text node js hello

how js manipulat dom 
Now the DOM tree is live and ready then browser run the javascript then javascript can talk to the DOM tree in memory and change 
Then the browser automatically triggers a repaint of that part of the page

<h1>Hello</h1>
<button>Change</button>

document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "World";
});

document â†’ the DOM tree
querySelector("button") â†’ finds the <button> node in the DOM tree
addEventListener("click", â€¦) â†’ tells the browser: â€œwhen user clicks this button, run this function
nside the function:
document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "World";
ðŸ‘‰ Finds the <h1> node in the DOM tree â†’ updates its text to "World" â†’ browser sees the change â†’ updates the screen.

virtual Dom 
when the code run in browser react first take the orginal DOM copy that called virtual DOM

What is the use of virtual DOM?
If any state is changed or props change the component is render at the time if any changes happen react will take the another copy that is anohter virtual dom
then react compare the that 2 virtual DOM which element is changes happen that only update in real DOM here DIFF algorithem used 

What is the diffing algorithm?
An algorithm that efficiently compares the old and new Virtual DOM trees.
Detects which nodes are added, removed, or changed.
Uses the key prop in lists to match elements properly.

 What is reconciliation?
the diffing algo is used for compare reconciltion is after comapre update updated or added part thr real DOM
and changes happened
